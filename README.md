# Blackjack Python

Welcome to the **Blackjack Game** project! This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Blackjack card game. Designed to simulate the experience of playing Blackjack in a casino, this project includes three unique versions of the game to explore different coding approaches and game mechanics.

## Project Overview

**Blackjack Python** is a text-based game where users can play against the computer dealer, simulating the well-known card game. Each of the three implementations in this repository provides a different take on gameplay logic and structure, giving insights into multiple coding methods for game development. This project serves as a demonstration of Python programming skills and game logic implementation.

## Features

- **Three Unique Implementations**: Explore three versions of the game, each coded differently to highlight variations in structure and approach.
- **Classic Blackjack Rules**: Standard gameplay elements like hitting, standing, doubling down, and dealer rules.
- **User-Friendly Text-Based Interface**: Simple interface for intuitive gameplay.
- **Randomized Deck and Fair Play**: Each game starts with a shuffled deck for a fair and randomized experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** is required. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saidakhmad77/Blackjack_python.git
   cd Blackjack_python
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python blackjack_game.py
   ```
   *(Replace `blackjack_game.py` with the actual filename for the main script of each implementation, if different.)*

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Each player is dealt two cards.
   - Players can choose to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
   - The dealer also draws cards, following a specific set of rules.
   - The player with the closest score to 21 without exceeding it wins the round.

## Future Enhancements

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Build a visually appealing frontend for the game using React, making it more interactive and enjoyable.
- **Score Tracking**: Implement local storage to save player scores and display high scores on the frontend.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language used to build game logic and functionality.
